<p>
the sand of your touch
first so warm and so much
feel its weight like a child
buried deep.
at the beach.
by siblings.

the comfort is surrounding
but the waves still are pounding
as grains wisp by and tickle my face
i cannot.
dig out.
by myself.

aint this risk the truest rush?
a timeless story that makes you blush
wrapped in thick sandy sun and embracing
oceanview.
you always.
by my side.


the sun steps into the water
friends help me up from the shore
go home, wash it off, try to sleep.
little crystals.
are stuck.
in my hair.

with time i would know
that you never find just one grain of sand
though crushed, old rocks keep close
a reminder.
everything.
is connected.

and that blown from afar
or caked hard where you are
there’s no castles
just the dunes.
and the reeds.
and the sea.


love is not just the sand
you can hold in your hand
it’s the land. -scape that grows
past the beaches.
beyond what.
we can know.

i still think the coast is beautiful
still cherish the sun and the water
yet i no longer bow at its altar
and the sand.
in my hair.
i put there.

incomplete but linked
unattached but connected
countless grains
complexity.
countless ways.
to be free.</p>
